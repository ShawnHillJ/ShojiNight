In order to use all of the character asset states in The Succubus Twins Character Pack,
please be sure to use the following settings.

Method 1
- 1. When dragging a model from the project folder to the scene, you must modify the number of bones to use per vertex for - skinning.
- 2. Bring the model into the scene and then double click on it.
- 3. In the Inspector Tab look for the "Quality" setting and change it from "Auto" to "4 Bones."
- 4. Now you are finished.
- 5. In addition, this procedure must be followed for each model you bring into the scene.

Method 2
- 1. Choose Edit > Project > Settings > Quality.
- 2. In the Inspector tab, choose Other > Blend Weights and set that to "4 Bones."
- 3. With this method there is no need to adjust model configurations each time they are brought into the scene.

Method 3
- 1. You can now set the Alpha cutoff of the toon_cutoff shader. 0.9 is the recommended setting.

Method 4
- If your intensity setting on the light is high, white clipping may occur.
